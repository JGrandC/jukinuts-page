                <p>
                  Currently, only about 10% of Ghana&apos;s cashews are processed domestically, leaving room for growth and development.
                  By promoting local processing, We help increase the value added to Ghana&apos;s exports, potentially boosting the country&apos;economy.
                  We contribute to Ghana&apos;s efforts to increase local processing of cashews, which can lead to higher returns and economic growth.
